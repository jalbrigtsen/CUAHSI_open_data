Johanne Albrigtsen
Professional Introduction:
Johanne (she/her) is a PhD student in the Graduate Program of Hydrologic Sciences at the University of Nevada, Reno. She is also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Gender, Race, and Identity studies. She graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a bachelors degree in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Ecology. Post-graduation Johanne worked as a field technician on the North Slope of the Brooks Range and Denali National Park, both in Alaska. Carrying on with her arctic and subarctic interests, she is excited to be continuing research in Denali National Park investigating snow-soil-vegetation interactions through an ecohydrological framework. When not trudging through the snow or shrubs up north, Johanne enjoys mountain biking, bikepacking, and swimming in (arguably too cold) bodies of water. 

Module Goals:
1) I am excited to learn how to make my data/programming as accessible as I can. I see data accessibility as an important facet of further breaking down the historically exclusive nature of academic sciences.
2) I have heard from many different professors/professionals/peers the merits of using GitHub - I am excited to finally delve in and start to learn about (and apply) them myself. 
3) I use mostly R in my research but am interested in learning when python might be a better choice.
